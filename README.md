# Profitability Analysis: Insights for New Movie Studio

## Project Overview
In this group project, we aimed to analyze the factors influencing movie profitability using data from various movie metrics, such as budget, genre, release season, and the involvement of top actors and directors. Our goal was to identify key drivers of profitability and provide actionable recommendations to a new movie studio for maximizing returns on their investments.

## Introduction
The movie industry is a highly competitive environment,  and understanding what makes a movie profitable is essential for success. In this project, we explored various factors like budget, genre, release season, and star power to uncover what contributes most to movie profitability. Our analysis was performed using real-world movie data, and we applied statistical hypothesis testing to validate our findings.
    
## Data Preprocessing
We began by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset. This involved handling missing values, normalizing data where necessary, and transforming the dataset to extract meaningful features. Key features considered included:

**Movie Profit/Loss:** The financial success of the movie, calculated as revenue minus production budget.

**Production Budget:** The total budget allocated for the production of the movie.

**Genres:** The different genres a movie may belong to (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).

**Actors and Directors:** Key cast and crew members who could potentially influence the movie's success.

**Season of Release:** The quarter or season in which the movie was released (e.g., Summer, Fall, Winter).


## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To understand the distribution of our data, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA). Some of the key EDA steps included:

**• Visualizing top actors by total profit:** We identified the actors with the highest total profits from their movie roles.

**• Analyzing genre profitability:** We explored which movie genres produced the highest average profits.

**• Seasonal trends:** We examined how movie release timing (e.g., Summer vs. Winter) impacted profitability.

## Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
To validate our findings, we performed several statistical tests:

**1. ANOVA for Genre Effect:** We tested whether the movie genre affected profitability using a one-way ANOVA test.
    
**2. ANOVA for Seasonal Effect:** We evaluated if release season influenced profitability with another ANOVA test.
    
**3. Pearson Correlation for Budget and Profit:** We assessed whether there was a correlation between the production budget and profitability.
    
**4. Chi-Square Test for Actor Influence:** We tested if top actors’ involvement influenced the likelihood of a movie being highly profitable.

### Hypothesis Testing Summary:

**• Genre:** We rejected the null hypothesis that genre does not significantly affect profitability.

**• Season:** We rejected the Null Hypothesis that the season that a movie is released does not significantly affect profitability.

**• Budget:** While the budget showed no direct significant correlation, we noted that larger budgets did not always equate to higher returns.

**• Star Power:** We found strong evidence that the involvement of top actors correlates with higher profitability.

## Key Findings

**1: Genre:** The most profitable genres are Action, Adventure, and Comedy.![average-profit-by-genre](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f143153-e70d-46a6-aa2e-24378938c8de)


**2: Season:** Summer releases tend to generate higher average profits than movies released in Fall or Winter.![average-movie-profit-by-season](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b691fe2-c35a-405b-aa66-1c5d7e2c05cc)


**3: Budget:** While higher budgets were often linked to higher grosses, they did not always yield the best return on investment (ROI). Moderate-budget movies performed well.![production-budget-vs-profit-loss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56ba16e3-0c16-4270-87b1-17854f331cf8)


**4: Star Power:** Star power plays a significant role in profitability, with movies featuring top actors delivering the highest returns.


## Business Recommendations
**1. Focus on High-Returning Genres:** Prioritize top-performing genres like Mystery, Horror, Comedy, Music, Animation, Romance, Adventure, and Action which demonstrated the highest average profits.

**2. Optimize Release Timing:** Schedule major releases in Summer, and Winter when average profits are comparatively higher compared to Fall and Spring.

**3. Budget Allocation Strategy:** Target a production budget range of $80 million to maximize return on investment (ROI). Be cautious with ultra-high budgets (> $150 million) as they can generate large grosses but with more variability in ROI.

**4. Leverage Star Power Selectively:** Cast top-performing actors and directors to increase the performance in the box office. Negotiate profit-sharing deals to mitigate upfront costs. Balance marquee talent with emerging stars to control salary expenses while still attracting audiences.

**5. Seasonal Marketing and Distribution:** Align marketing spenditure and distribution partnerships around peak seasons (Summer/ Winter). For off-peak seasons, consider more strategic, low-cost distribution methods such as streaming services.
    
## Conclusion
This project demonstrated how different factors impact movie profitability and offered actionable insights that can help a new movie studio maximize profits. By understanding the financial drivers of success—such as genre, budget, star power, and release season—studios can better strategize their productions, ultimately improving their financial outcomes.
